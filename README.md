## Overview
The work day scheduler is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by `jQuery`.

The application also uses `Bootstrap` framework for CSS manipulation and `Moment.js` library for date and time events. Tasks are stored in and retrieved from `localStorage`.
